/**
 * FeedForward
 * 
 * Stores the feedfoward constants, and allows for quick computation.
 * Feedfoward should be used in systems that require smooth precise movements
 * and have high inertia, such as drivetrains and lifts.
 * 
 * This is best used alongside a PID loop, with the form:
 * output = pid.get() + feedforward.calculate(v, a);
 * 
 * In this case, the feedforward does the majority of the heavy lifting, and the 
 * pid loop only corrects for inconsistencies
 * 
 * For information about tuning feedforward, I reccommend looking at this post:
 * https://www.chiefdelphi.com/t/paper-frc-drivetrain-characterization/160915
 * (yes I know it's for FRC but trust me, it's useful)
